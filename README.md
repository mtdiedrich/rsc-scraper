# rsc-scraper

Detailed running instructions in progress.

Can run via sh script or ps1 script. 

All files must be in the same folder. Takes in input CSV with 3 columns. Practically speaking, the first two columns are irrelevant, but the third must be the TRN link.

Outputs data to 'mmr.csv' in the same folder. 'None' in any column indicates that the scraper failed to find that data - this may be caused by the scraper failing, by a bad tracker link, or by a tracker profile that's abnormal (among other reasons).

Contributions welcome!
